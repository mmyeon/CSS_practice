    Now, open the page and slowly resize your browser. You’ll see the font scale
    smoothly as you do. The 0.5 em here operates as a sort of minimum font size,
    and the 1 vw adds a responsive scalar. This’ll give you a base font size
    that scales from 11.75 px on an iPhone 6 up to 20 px in a 1,200 px browser
    window. You can adjust these values to your liking. You’ve now accomplished
    a large piece of your responsive strategy without a single media query.
    Instead of three or four hard-coded breakpoints, everything on your page
    will scale fluidly according to the viewport.
